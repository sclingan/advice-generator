## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a lot about async and await, using an API to get data. I also learned about
formating data to get exactly what you need to present to users.


### Continued development

I want to learn more about using API's and trying different approaches
to getting data to display.
